        <h1>About Vinland Saga</h1>
        <h2>Vinland Saga is a thrilling anime that takes place during the Viking era, 
        focusing on the journey of Thorfinn as he seeks revenge and discovers the 
        true meaning of being a warrior. The ideology of Christ is deeply woven 
        into the anime. It is Inspired by the King of Norway Olaf Tryggvason, 
        Yukimura decided to write Vinland Saga as a story about slavery. Yukimura's 
        editor was against the original idea of Thorfinn being a slave; so the 
        character was changed to that of a Viking. The author agreed, as he wanted 
        Thorfinn to come to understand the tragedy he causes as a Viking, in later 
        parts of the narrative. Yukimura's sensation during the Cold War and the 
        September 11 attacks was projected on Thorfinn's character, who is 
        traumatized by his actions as a warrior and thus decides to find Vinland 
        in order to make a land where people from different races are able to live 
        together peacefully.</h2>
